# Cloud Formation - IaC

## Templates: 
CloudFormation uses templates written in JSON or YAML format to describe the desired AWS resources and their configurations. These templates define the structure of your infrastructure.
## Stacks: 
A stack is a collection of AWS resources created and managed as a single unit. You create a stack by providing a CloudFormation template, and CloudFormation handles the creation, updating, and deletion of the resources defined in the template.
